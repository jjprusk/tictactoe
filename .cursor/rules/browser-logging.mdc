Rule: Frontend logging must use `sendLog`

- All browser-side logging in `client/**` must go through `sendLog(level, feature, payload?)` from `client/src/utils/clientLogger.ts`.
- Do not use `console.*` in committed code. For temporary debugging, refactor to `sendLog` before commit.
- This routes logs to the server `/logs` endpoint and writes to the repo root `LOG` file via Pino.
