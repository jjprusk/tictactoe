# TicTacToe AI

A web-based TicTacToe game with a backend-only neural AI that learns from gameplay. The frontend is a lightweight React UI communicating with the server via Socket.IO. See `docs/request.md` for requirements and `docs/implementation_plan.md` for the ordered implementation steps.

## Repository Layout
- `server/`: Node.js server (Express + Socket.IO), AI orchestration, persistence, observability
- `client/`: React + TypeScript frontend (mobile-first, real-time UX)
