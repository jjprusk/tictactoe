# Neurosymbolic AI Implementation Plan

You are an AI expert tasked with creating a detailed implementation plan for implementing and integrating neurosymbolic AI capabilities into an existing board game system, starting with Tic-Tac-Toe as the initial prototype. The framework is currently implemented with a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game, using a Node.js server, React client, and MongoDB. The system currently supports function calls like makeMove(board, opponent-level) to invoke AI moves, uses a MongoDB database for storage, and has a unified logging system for both client and server logging. The goal is to enhance the system with an AI to learn games from scratch using neurosymbolic techniques, enabling it to discover and store human-readable rules while supporting self-play, cloning at specific expertise levels, comprehensive metrics, and extensibility to other games.

## Key Requirements
1.  The AI must be extendable to a variety of games, including board games (e.g., Tic-Tac-Toe, Checkers, Chess) and card games (e.g., Blackjack, 31, Continental). Account for game-specific nuances, such as state representation (e.g., grid for boards vs. decks/hands for cards) and handling partial observability in card games.

2.  The AI should learn any game from scratch with zero initial knowledge of rules, dynamics, or strategies, relying on self-play and interaction with a black-box environment simulator.

3.  Implement the AI as a subsystem within the overall game framework, ensuring seamless integration without disrupting existing components.

4.  The AI must be neurosymbolic, combining neural networks (for pattern recognition and policy learning) with symbolic reasoning (for logical inference and rule extraction). It should save human-understandable rules (e.g., if-then statements, logical expressions) in the existing MongoDB database, extending the schema as needed (e.g., collections for rules, with fields for game type, rule description, discovery timestamp, confidence score).

5.  Support self-play mechanisms for training, where the AI plays against itself to generate data and refine its model.

6.  Enable cloning of the AI once it reaches a specified loss ratio or performance threshold (e.g., win/draw rate). Clones should be frozen (no further learning) and selectable for play against human opponents at that expertise level. Continue learning on the main AI to create multiple clones over time (e.g., beginner, intermediate, expert levels).

7.  At specified intervals (e.g., every 100 episodes or when new patterns are detected), update the MongoDB rule database with newly discovered rules, ensuring deduplication and versioning.

8.  Determine and justify whether clone storage includes both the rule database snapshot and neural network weights, or just the rules, based on tradeoffs (e.g., full snapshot for accurate replication vs. rules-only for lighter storage and interpretability). Default to including both unless justified otherwise.

9.  Implement comprehensive metrics tracking and visualization, stored in MongoDB and viewable via a dashboard or API (e.g., using libraries like Matplotlib/Plotly for graphs, integrated with existing UI). Metrics should include: time to make a move, board heat maps (visualizing policy probabilities), graphs of game loss ratios over time, graphs of move time, a rule viewer with filter/search capability (e.g., by game, rule type, discovery date), and additional sensible metrics like episode length, exploration rate, rule utilization frequency, neural loss curves, win rates vs. baselines, and real-time monitoring.

10.  Maintain or extend the single entry point function, e.g., makeMove(board, opponent-level), which processes the current game state, invokes the AI for analysis, updates its internal state and metrics, and returns the move. For neurosymbolic processing, this could involve neural evaluation followed by symbolic rule checking.

11.  Add other requirements as necessary to accomplish the goals, such as: handling partial observability (for games with hidden info like card games), ensuring scalability (e.g., parallel self-play with distributed computing), incorporating error handling and logging using the currently implemented unified logging system, defining a testing framework (unit tests for rule extraction, integration tests for self-play), considering ethical aspects like fairness in AI opponents and bias mitigation in rule discovery, specifying hardware/compute needs (e.g., GPU for RL training), ensuring secure storage of rules and models in MongoDB to prevent tampering, and assuming a Python-based tech stack with PyTorch for neural components.

12.  Analyze the current state-of-the-art (as of August 30, 2025) in neurosymbolic AI technologies, especially for game-playing agents (e.g., hybrids of MuZero-like RL with symbolic logic). Recommend specific technologies, frameworks, or libraries (e.g., IBM Neuro-Symbolic AI Toolkit, Logic Tensor Networks, or custom integrations with PyTorch and symbolic tools like FOL reasoners). Discuss tradeoffs (e.g., ease of implementation vs. performance, interpretability vs. training efficiency) and provide rationale for choices, drawing from recent advancements like neural-symbolic RL for POMDP games. Include references to 2024-2025 papers or surveys (e.g., from arXiv) to support recommendations.

## Output Format
Create a step-by-step implementation plan in Markdown format for readability, including:
•  High-level architecture diagram (text-based).
•  Technology stack recommendations with justifications.
•  Very detailed steps for implementation and integration, broken down into sub-steps (e.g., Step 1.1: Install dependencies; 1.2: Configure…; include code examples, configuration changes, and testing procedures like unit tests with sample data).
•  Timeline estimates (e.g., phases for prototyping, testing, scaling).
•  Potential risks and mitigations.
•  Code snippets or pseudocode for key components (e.g., rule extraction function, makeMove extension).

## Plan coda
Ensure the plan is feasible, modular, and aligns with all requirements for a robust, extendable system. Prototype with simpler games before scaling to complex ones.
